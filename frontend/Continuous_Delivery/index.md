Continuous Delivery
===================

Background
----------

We use Continuous Integration and Delivery practices.Â 

Continuous Integration ensures that small code part is delivered to repository frequently and integrated with existing codebase without any errors (more you can read on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)).

Continuous Delivery practice guarantees that software can be reliably released at any time (more informations you can find in [Continuous Delivery article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)).  

For CI / CD we use [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/about-circleci/).
