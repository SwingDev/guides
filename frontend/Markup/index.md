Markup
======

Background
----------

Even if you work in framework environment, you should keep in mind writing semantic markup. This means that markup should contain [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) introduced mostly in [HTML5 standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).  

For coding static sites we recommend using any template engine like [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) or [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html).

We recommend you to take a look at this [set of rules](https://github.com/hail2u/html-best-practices) of writing HTML.

Rules
-----

*   Use semantic elements whenever you can  
    
*   When coding static sites, prefer templates engines over bare HTML  
    
*   Declare attributes starting from _class_, _type_ and end with _style_  
    
    *   always follow linter settings - especially in React or Vue.js environment  
        
*   Use double quotes for declaring value of the attribute ([reference](https://github.com/hail2u/html-best-practices#dont-mix-quotation-marks))  
    
*   Be consistent with [HTML formatting](https://developers.google.com/style/html-formatting)
