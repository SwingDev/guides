Computer setup
==============

Background
----------

The computer is our primary tool. It seems obvious, but we tend to forget about a proper setup. The rightly configured computer can save you much time during development. It's better to do it once and right than to fight with your machine.

Rules
-----

Before you start working check if you

*   Installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
    
*   Installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)  
    
*   Installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with NPM (LTS is recommended)  
    
*   Installed [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Node Version Manager)*  
    
*   Installed [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)*  
    
*   Installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) from official repository (Homebrew version is broken and won't work)  
    

*_ these we recommend to install by Homebrew_
