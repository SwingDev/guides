Develop in Docker
=================

Background
----------

We recommend using Docker for working on your application. Docker is a platform which allows you to run your application in specific virtual environments. This ensures that your application will work no matter what OS or software you currently use. More about Docker you can find [here](https://www.docker.com/what-docker).

To get familiar with our Docker setup, you can take a look at the example [setup](https://github.com/SwingDev/swg-cat-bootstrap).

Rules
-----

*   if something does not work / would require you to go around Docker - fix it or tell us, and we'll fix it together.  
    
*   this way we can be sure nothing changes on CI and after deployment → you're looking at the same application
