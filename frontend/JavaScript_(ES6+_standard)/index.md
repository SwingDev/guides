JavaScript (ES6+ standard)
==========================

Background
----------

ECMAScript 6, known as JavaScript ES6 or ES6, is a modern standard of one of the most popular programming languages. It introduces several new APIs, like spread operator, template strings, and others. Initially introduced by Babel transpiler, now it's an industry standard, thanks to good [browser support](https://caniuse.com/#search=es6).

Along with Typescript, ES6 is our primary language of choice. It's supported by React and Vue.js frameworks, which we use in our daily basis work.
